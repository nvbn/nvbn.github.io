![book cover](/assets/hop_book.jpg) As I sometimes use Perl, I decided
to read something about it. And [Higher-Order Perl by Mark Jason Dominus](https://hop.perl.plover.com/cover.html)
was looking interesting. The book is really nice, it shows
that Perl can be kind of a functional programming language and that
it's possible to implement almost every feature from other languages in Perl.
Also, after reading the book, I think there's copious amount
of ways to shot yourself in the leg in Perl.

The problems in the book are interesting and a bit challenging, so I think
it can be worth reading even for people who don't work with Perl.
