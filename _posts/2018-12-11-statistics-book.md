![book cover](/assets/statistics_book.jpg) Recently I've noticed that
I'm lacking some basics in statistics and got recommended to read
[The Cartoon Guide to Statistics by Larry Gonick and Woollcott Smith](https://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-Guide-Statistics-Larry-Gonick-ebook/dp/B00SRYUW5O).
The format of the book is a bit silly, but it covers a lot of topics and
explains things in easy to understand way. The book has a lot of images
and some kind of related stories for explained topics.

Although I'm not a big fan of the book format, the book seems to be nice.
