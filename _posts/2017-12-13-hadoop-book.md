![book cover](/assets/hadoop_book.jpg) Around a month ago I've started working with Hadoop,
so I decided that I need to read something about it, and chose
[Hadoop: The Definitive Guide by Tom White](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033448.do)
that I already had from [the Humble Book Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/data-science-books).
The book contains a lot of information about Hadoop internals and related stack with use cases
and examples. And I guess there are too much huge code samples with all boilerplate. And too many
pages are like *some option &ndash; description*, there's already the documentation for things like that. 

But overall the book is good. After reading it I feel way more confident with Hadoop.
