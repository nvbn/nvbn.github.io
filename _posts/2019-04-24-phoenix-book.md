![book cover white](/assets/phoenix_book.jpg) Not so long ago I got recommended to read [The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford](https://itrevolution.com/book/the-phoenix-project/), and I've got a bit of mixed
feelings about the book.

The first part of the book is entertaining, as it shows that everything is
bad and becoming even worse. It sounds like something from real life and
reminds of some work situations.

The second part is still interesting, as it describes how they're solving
their problems in an iterative way, without going overboard.

The last part is kind of meh, too cheerful and happy, and like devops are going
to solve all possible problems, and how magically everything works.
