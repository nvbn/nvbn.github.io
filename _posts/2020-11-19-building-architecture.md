![book cover white](/assets/building_architecture_book.jpeg) Recently I've read [Building Evolutionary Architectures by Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, Patrick Kua](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-evolutionary-architectures/9781491986356/)
and it's an interesting book. It shows how an architecture of a system
might need to change over time, and with what principles and ideas it can be built
to make the whole process less painful. The part about the possible changes in
the data side of an application was useful for me. A nice thing
that the book doesn't try to sell a specific architecture (like microservices books),
but covers different approaches.

As a downside, the examples/case studies in the book are about not that big systems, and the idea of testing and automatically measuring architecture complexity
doesn't sound that much applicable to something a bit bigger.
