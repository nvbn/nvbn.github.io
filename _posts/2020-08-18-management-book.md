![book cover](/assets/management_book.jpg) Recently
I wanted to read something about the old school and not
new fancy tech management, so I decided to read
[High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884). And I enjoyed the book. It gives a
gasp into a management role with a few cases with
explained decisions and outcomes. Although the book
is a bit old, it still sounds relevant and a lot of
described processes I've experienced at work.

Overall the book is a nice reading, but I'm not a manager though.
