![book cover](/assets/design_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read something about
UI and UX and I was recommended to read [The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654).
Even I'm not a UI/UX specialist at all, it's one of the most interesting books I've read lately.
It contains a lot of real-life examples with deep explanations why something is done wrongly
and poorly, and it has points and ideas how to make it better.

Although the book is a bit repetitive.
