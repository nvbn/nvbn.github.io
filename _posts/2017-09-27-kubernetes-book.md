![book cover white](/assets/k8ns_book.png) Recently I decided to
read something more about Kubernetes and found
[The Kubernetes Book by Nigel Poulton](https://leanpub.com/thekubernetesbook).
And I've made a wrong choice because it's an introductory book explaining
basic concepts with very simple examples.

I don’t know, maybe it’s a good book to start working with Kubernetes.
