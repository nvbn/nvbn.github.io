![book cover white](/assets/ml_python_book.jpg) Recently I've started to play in
a data scientist a bit more and found that I'm not that much know machine
learning basics, so I've decided to read
[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Sarah Guido and Andreas C. Müller](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/).
It's a nice book, it explains fundamental concepts without going to
deep and without requiring much of a math background.
The book has a lot of simple synthetic and kind of real-life examples and covers a few
popular use cases.

Although, in some chapters, it felt like reading a Jupyter notebook, but I've
enjoyed an example with "this is how we get ants".
