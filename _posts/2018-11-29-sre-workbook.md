![book cover white](/assets/sre_workbook.jpg) More than two years ago I've read
[SRE Book](/2016/08/19/sre-book/), and now I finally found a time
to read [The Site Reliability Workbook by Betsy Beyer, Niall Richard Murphy, David K. Rensin, Kent Kawahara and Stephen Thorne](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/).
This book is more interesting, as it's less idealistic and contains a lot of cases
from real life. The book has examples of correct and wrong SLOs, explains how to properly
implement alerts based on your error budget, and even a bit covers *human part* of SRE.

Overall SRE Workbook is one of the best books I've read recently, but it might be because
the last few weeks I was doing related things at work.
