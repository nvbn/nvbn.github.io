![book cover white](/assets/monolith_to_microservices_book.png) Recently I decided
to up my "microservices" game a bit and read
[Monolith To Microservices by Sam Newman](https://samnewman.io/books/monolith-to-microservices/).
I enjoyed this book more than the first microservices book, it's not so upbeat and cheerful, and
doesn't have this annoying "everything should be on microservices" vibe, it even sometimes
suggests that something might be better not as a microservice. Apart from that, the book covers
a bunch of patterns for gradual extraction of parts of a monolith to a few microservices
in an iteretive way. It also covers a few ways to separate the storage without breaking
existing applications.

Overall for me it was interesting reading.
