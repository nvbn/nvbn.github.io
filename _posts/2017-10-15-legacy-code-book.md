![book cover](/assets/legacy_code_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read something
about refactoring and about working with not so good code, so I
decided to read [Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052).
And it seems to be a good book, it contains a lot of recipes and
techniques for making the code more testable, for removing dependencies
and for making the code better generally.

Although the book is a bit too OOPish and a bit old, I think it's
still useful.
