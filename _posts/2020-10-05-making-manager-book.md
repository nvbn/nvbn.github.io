![book cover](/assets/making_manager_book.jpg) Not so long ago I decided to
read [The Making of a Manager by Julie Zhuo](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/manager.html), and
it seemed to be mostly a nice book. The book explains the role nicely and gives a few self-checks
if the role is interesting for you or not. It has good content on preparing and delivering feedback,
which was quite useful, at least for me. The book also covers a few good points on organizing
communication and improving meetings.

On the other side, some parts of the book felt a bit too facebook specific.
But overall, the book is interesting and useful.
