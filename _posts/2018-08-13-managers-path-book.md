![book cover](/assets/managers_path_book.jpg) As sometimes I need to take a role
of a manager of a small team, I decided to read something about that. So I chose
to read [The Manager's Path by Camille Fournier](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do).
The book covers different stages of manager's growth with advice and related stories.
And it's interesting to read, for me it was kind of leisure reading.

Although most parts of the book were way over my level, it was fun to read
about different roles and expectations from people working on those roles.
*I've probably even understood the difference between VP and CTO.*
