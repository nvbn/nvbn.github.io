![book cover white](/assets/ocaml_book.png) Around a month ago I've started playing around
Reason and for understanding it better I decided to read something about OCaml
and chose [Real World OCaml by Anil Madhavapeddy, Jason Hickey, and Yaron Minsky](https://realworldocaml.org/).
The book explains OCaml syntax, core library, different aspects of language and how to write
FP and OOP code in OCaml. The book has a lot of examples and easy to read, not that much
repetitive as a lot of books about programming languages.
 
Although before reading the book I thought that OCaml isn't that much over-bloated and
is a better language, especially it's syntax. It helped me to better understand
concepts and ideas behind Reason.
