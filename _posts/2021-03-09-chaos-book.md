![book cover white](/assets/chaos_book.jpeg) I heard a bunch of good
things about [Chaos Engineering by Casey Rosenthal and Nora Jones](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781492043850/),
so I decided to read it.
And it's actually a nice and useful book. It does a good job
in explaining that chaos engineering isn't a magical randomly
failing chaos monkey stuff, but an experimentation-based approach
with measurable and predictable outcomes. The book contains a lot
of real-life examples (mostly good) of chaos engineering in different
companies from tech, processes, and people sides.
