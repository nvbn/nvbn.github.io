![book cover white](/assets/streaming_book.png) Recently I started to
go a bit deeper in data processing and decided that it would be nice
to read
[Streaming Systems by Tyler Akidau, Slava Chernyak, and Reuven Lax](http://streamingsystems.net/). It covers fundamentals and inside machinery
of streaming systems, with explanations and examples.
The book also has [a bunch of nice gifs](http://streamingsystems.net/fig)
that help to understand how everything works. I also enjoyed the last
chapter with a brief history of big data processing and some sort of
explanation of why all those things created the way they created.

From the not so nice part sometimes the book feels a bit too much
Google tech stack centric, and the images in the book are sometimes
hard to understand, but gifs on the book's website solved that for me.
