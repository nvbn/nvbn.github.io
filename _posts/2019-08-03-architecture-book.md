![book cover](/assets/clean_architecture_book.jpg) Recently I decided
to read [Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/)
as I'm still trying to read something about system architecture and
I had a good experience with *Clean* books in the past. And I
kind of enjoyed it.

The book is about software architecture in general but mostly
focused on "one piece of software" architecture. It nicely
explains a few ways of proper separation of an application into
different independent parts without going too deep into
enterprise-ish practices and patterns. The book also shows a bunch
of examples of how to abstract away implementation details,
but also warns to not overdo and not over-engineer things.

Although sometimes it feels too basic and covers a lot of
general knowledge, it's a nice and useful book to read.
