![book cover white](/assets/sre_book.jpg) Not so long ago I wanted to
read something about DevOps and processes in real organisations. So
I chose [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do?sortby=publicationDate).
And it nicely explains about deploy, failures recovery, support and other
SRE aspects from engineering and management points of view. Also
it interesting to read about problems and solutions of huge systems.

However the book is informative, but it's a bit boring. And almost most
of cases are Google specific or can be a problem only on a very large systems.
