![book cover](/assets/mom_test_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read something that can
help with meetings and talks with non-technical people. And I was recommended to read
[The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick](http://momtestbook.com/). It's a short book and it's
an easy reading, the book has a few valid points and ideas. It explains author's points
by showing example dialogs with highlighted bad and good parts.

From the other side, the book gives too startup-ish/entrepreneur-ish in a bad way aftertaste.
