![book cover white](/assets/graphite_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read something
about Graphite and monitoring in general, as I sometimes need to interact with it.
And I've found [Monitoring with Graphite by Jason Dixon](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035794.do)
and read it. It's kind of a nice book with history, explanation of the architecture and use cases
of Graphite. It's not that long and easy to read.

Can contain a bit less information of Graphite's ugly interface though.
