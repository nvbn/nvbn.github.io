![book cover](/assets/fsharp_book.png) Few months ago I decided to try something
different, like different platform and different language. As I mostly work
with Python/JS/JVM langs, I chose .NET and F#. So I read [The Book of F# by Dave Fancher](https://www.nostarch.com/fsharp)
from [Joy of Coding bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/joy-of-coding-book-bundle).
And it was interesting. In the book aspects of F# are nicely explained with examples.
Also book covers non-straightforward parts of the language, and explains why
it was made that way.

Although author of the book assumed that readers would be familiar with .NET
platform and C#, it wasn't a problem at all.
