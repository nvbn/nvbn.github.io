![book cover white](/assets/google_book.jpg) Not so long ago I stumbled upon
[Software Engineering at Google by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, Hyrum Wright](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/),
and decided to read it. Most parts of the book are nice, especially the parts
about engineering management, about the deprecation processes, and about their
build systems and infrastructure. Some parts are too basic and a bit
obvious, e.g. almost every chapter about testing. The culture part
of the book even sounds like some sort of a company handbook, which is kind of
ok for the book with a company name in the title.

In general, the book is nice and mostly interesting to read. It gives a sneaky
peek in the company work environment, culture, and processes with good and
bad parts. *The book also has some corporate vibes, that some people might
even start missing because of the lockdown.*
