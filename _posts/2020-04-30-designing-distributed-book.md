![book cover white](/assets/designing_distributed_book.png) Recently I thought that
it might be nice to read
[Designing Distributed Systems by Brendan Burns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-distributed-systems/9781491983638/). The idea of this book to show (or even define) common patterns of parts
of distributed systems is awesome, but the book doesn't have it. Some parts of the book are nice,
it has a good explanation of serverless. But most of the book is just examples of different ways to
put containers in Kubernetes.

The use cases in the book are really weird
(eg use of a sidecar container to add https to a legacy app you don't have source code of, what?)
or I'm using Kubernetes in a wrong way.
