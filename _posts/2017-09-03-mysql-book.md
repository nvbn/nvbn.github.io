![book cover white](/assets/mysql_book.jpg) Apart from using [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/),
I haven't touched MySQL for a while, so I decided to freshen up things and read
[High Performance MySQL by Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, and Vadim Tkachenko](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022343.do).
The book feels solid, it explains how MySQL works (and worked before) inside,
what problems storage engines/parser/optimizer/etc have and how to leverage them.
It's kind of nice that a big part of the book is about MySQL scaling. And it's
also good that the book has a lot of information about troubleshooting, debugging,
profiling and some MySQL related tools.

Although the book is probably a bit outdated, it covers MySQL versions up to 5.5, but
nowadays the latest version is  5.7.
