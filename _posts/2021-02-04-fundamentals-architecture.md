![book cover white](/assets/fundamentals_book.jpeg) Recently I finished reading
[Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards, Neal Ford](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/).
From my point of view, it's mostly a good book. I really enjoyed the part where different
architecture approaches were explained and the idea of scorecards at the end of the chapters
which shows the pros and the cons of the described approaches is nice. I also liked that the book
doesn't go too much into implementation details and possible tech stacks, but mostly stays
on the high level.

The soft skills part of the book about behavior and handshaking with other people is a bit weird.
The example with the bullying of a Scala enthusiast to convince them to stop pushing Scala into the project
is kind of fun though.
