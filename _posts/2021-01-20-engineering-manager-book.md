I finished reading [Become an Effective Software Engineering Manager by James Stanier](https://pragprog.com/titles/jsengman/become-an-effective-software-engineering-manager/). Overall it's a
nice book, it gives a good overview of possible responsibilities and
expectations, covers good and not so fun parts of the role, and
explains all the relevant ceremonies.
