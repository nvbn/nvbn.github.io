![book cover white](/assets/logstash_book.png) As I have an interest in monitoring and logging,
I decided to read [The Logstash Book by James Turnbull](https://www.logstashbook.com/).
And it's kind of a nice book, with examples and explanations about working with Logstash and ELK
stack. Also, it contains information about the ways to extend Logstash with plugins, even a few pages
about writing plugins on your own.

From the other side, the book is a bit too basic and a lot of it is primitive information about
deploying Logstash and related stack.
