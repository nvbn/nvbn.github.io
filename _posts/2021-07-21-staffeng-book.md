![book cover](/assets/staffeng_book.png) Recently I started to
look more and more at different directions to grow,
and [Staff Engineer by Will Larson](https://staffeng.com/book)
looked like a relevant book for that. The book explains
the responsibilities of senior+ engineers in different companies
with examples and real-life stories, which are even interesting to read.

The book also contains a bunch of advice for engineers who are looking into that direction, but at least for me they felt mostly as "do good don't do bad".
