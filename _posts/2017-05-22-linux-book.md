![book cover](/assets/linux_book.jpg) Lately, I was interested in Linux internals, so
I decided to read [Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Robert-Love/dp/0672329468).
It's an interesting book, it explains stuff from interrupts to vfs and memory management. It's
easy to read and contains information why historically something was done like it was.

Although the book is more for beginner kernel developers and contains a lot of code samples
of the kernel internals. It's worth reading if you just interested in how it works inside.
