![book cover](/assets/great_code_book.png) Recently, for studying, I was sometimes
required to use low-level stuff like C, so I decided to read something
about low-level things and chose to read [Write Great Code, Volume 1 by Randall Hyde](https://www.nostarch.com/greatcode.htm).
The book is a bit too low-level, it even explains how processors of different
architectures work inside, even on transistors level. Also, this book contains
interesting information about how memory works on different levels and how processor
uses different types of memory. Chapters about primitive data structures aren't  so interesting,
but they give basic knowledge of how things work inside.

Although this book can look a bit outdated, especially in the chapter about IO,
it's interesting to read and somehow it's even entertaining.
