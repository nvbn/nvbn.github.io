![book cover white](/assets/golang_book.jpg) Somehow I've started to use Go more and more, so
I decided to read something fundamental about it. [The Go Programming Language by Alan A. A. Donovan and‎ Brian W. Kernighan](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440/)
looked like a right choice. The book covers every aspect of the language from very basic things
like statements and variables to reflection and interop with C. It also covers some best practices,
and things that better not to do.

Although I'm not a big fan of Go and it's best practices, the book at least helped me to understand
why it's done that way a bit better.
