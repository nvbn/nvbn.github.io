![book cover white](/assets/nltk_book.jpg) Recently I've noticed that my NLP knowledge isn't that good.
So I decided to read [Natural Language Processing with Python by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper](http://www.nltk.org/book/),
and it's a nice book. It explains core concepts of NLP and how, where and why to use NLTK.
After each chapter, it has lots of exercises. I've tried to do most of them and spent a bit too much time on the book.

Although some parts of the book are too basic, it even has parts about using Python data-structures.
