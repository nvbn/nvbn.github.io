![Map with commute](/assets/commute/map.png) 

Since I moved to Amsterdam I'm biking to work almost every morning. And as Google is
always tracking the location of my phone, I thought that it might be interesting to do
something with that data.

First of all, I've downloaded Location History data dump in json from
[Download your data page](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout). The format of the dump is very simple,
it's a dict with `locations` key that contains a lot of entries like this in descendant order by date:

~~~json
{
    "timestampMs" : "1525120611682",
    "latitudeE7" : 523508799,
    "longitudeE7" : 488938179,
    "accuracy" : 15,
    "altitude" : 49,
    "verticalAccuracy" : 2
}
~~~

It's very easy to parse it with Python:

~~~python
import json
from datetime import datetime
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', 'latitude, longitude, datetime')


def read_points():
    with open('data.json') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    for point in data['locations']:
        yield Point(
            point['latitudeE7'] / 10 ** 7,
            point['longitudeE7'] / 10 ** 7,
            datetime.fromtimestamp(int(point['timestampMs']) / 1000)
        )
        
points = read_points()
~~~
~~~python
>>> [*points]
[Point(latitude=52.350879, longitude=4.893817, datetime=datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 30, 22, 36, 51, 682000)), ...]
~~~

As I moved to my current place in November, it's safe to ignore all entries before:

~~~python
from itertools import takewhile

from_date = datetime(2017, 11, 1)

after_move = takewhile(lambda point: point.datetime >= from_date, points)
~~~

And weekends:

~~~python
work_days = (point for point in after_move
             if point.datetime.weekday() < 5)
~~~

Usually, I'm heading to work between 9 am and 10 am, but as the Netherlands are switching between
summer and winter timezones, it will be safer to treat everything between 7 am and 9a m as possible commute time:

~~~python
from_hour = 7
to_hour = 12

commute_time = (point for point in work_days
                if from_hour <= point.datetime.hour < to_hour)
~~~

Then I grouped everything by date:

~~~python
from itertools import groupby

by_days = groupby(commute_time, key=lambda point: point.datetime.date())
~~~
~~~python
>>> [(day, [*vals]) for day, vals in by_days]
[(datetime.date(2018, 4, 27),
 [Point(latitude=52.350879, longitude=4.893817, datetime=datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 27, 11, 58, 17, 189000)), ...]),
 ...]
~~~

After that, I selected the last point at home and the first point at work for every day. A point considered home or work
if it's distance from home or work is smaller than 50 meters. The distance can be easily calculated with [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy):

~~~python
from geopy.distance import geodesic

home = (52.350879, 4.893817)  # not really =)
work = (52.3657573, 4.8980648)

max_distance = 0.050

def last_at_home(points):
    result = None
    for point in points:
        if geodesic(home, point[:2]).km <= max_distance:
            result = point
    return result


def first_at_work(points, after):
    for point in points:
        if point.datetime > after.datetime and geodesic(work, point[:2]).km <= max_distance:
            return point


Commute = namedtuple('Commute', 'day, start, end, took')


def get_commute():
    for day, points in by_days:
        points = [*points][::-1]

        start = last_at_home(points)
        if start is None:
            continue

        end = first_at_work(points, start)
        if end is None:
            continue

        yield Commute(
            day, start.datetime, end.datetime, end.datetime - start.datetime,
        )


commutes = [*get_commute()][::-1]
~~~
~~~python
>>> commutes
[Commute(day=datetime.date(2017, 11, 2), start=datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 2, 9, 39, 13, 219000), end=datetime.datetime(2017, 11, 2, 9, 52, 53, 295000), took=datetime.timedelta(0, 820, 76000)), ...]
~~~

Now it's easy to plot a graph of daily commute with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):

~~~python
from matplotlib import pyplot

fig, ax = pyplot.subplots()
ax.plot([commute.day for commute in commutes],
        [commute.took.total_seconds() / 60 for commute in commutes])

ax.set(xlabel='day', ylabel='commute (minutes)',
       title='Daily commute')
ax.grid()
pyplot.show()
~~~

It's easy to spot days when I had appointments in the morning:

Then I thought that it might be interesting to look for a correlation between
temperature and commute time, and wind speed and commute time. I found data dump
of daily weather that [KNMI provides](http://www.knmi.nl/nederland-nu/klimatologie/daggegevens),
the nearest meteorological station is in Schiphol airport, but I guess it's close enough.
The data is in easy to parse format:

~~~
# STN,YYYYMMDD,DDVEC,FHVEC,   FG,  FHX, FHXH,  FHN, FHNH,  FXX, FXXH,   TG,   TN,  TNH,   TX,  TXH, T10N,T10NH,   SQ,   SP,    Q,   DR,   RH,  RHX, RHXH,   PG,   PX,  PXH,   PN,  PNH,  VVN, VVNH,  VVX, VVXH,   NG,   UG,   UX,  UXH,   UN,  UNH, EV24

  240,19510101,  188,   77,   87,  195,   18,   41,   24,     ,     ,   12,  -13,    1,   26,   20,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     , 9891, 9957,     , 9837,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,    7,   90,   98,    6,   73,   20,     
  240,19510102,  153,   41,   41,   82,    4,   10,   21,     ,     ,   13,    7,    4,   18,   19,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,     , 9876, 9923,     , 9853,     ,     ,     ,     ,     ,    8,   93,   98,    9,   88,    1,     
~~~

I only used `FG` (Daily mean wind speed in 0.1 m/s) and `TG` (Daily mean temperature in 0.1 degrees Celsius):

~~~python
from dateutil.parser import parse

Weather = namedtuple('Weather', 'windspeed, temperature')


def read_weather():
    result = {}

    with open('weather.txt') as f:
        for line in f.readlines():
            if not line.startswith(' '):
                continue

            data = [part.strip() for part in line.split(',')]
            result[parse(data[1]).date()] = Weather(
                int(data[4]) / 10,
                int(data[11]) / 10,
            )

    return result

weather = read_weather()
~~~
~~~python
>>> weather
{datetime.date(1951, 1, 1): Weather(windspeed=8.7, temperature=1.2),
 datetime.date(1951, 1, 2): Weather(windspeed=4.1, temperature=1.3),
 datetime.date(1951, 1, 3): Weather(windspeed=2.1, temperature=0.3),
 ...}
~~~

Before doing this I've excluded spikes from days when I had appointments:

~~~python
normalized = [commute for commute in commutes
              if commute.took.total_seconds() < 60 * 20]
~~~

Then I created a scatter plot of temperature and commute:

~~~python
fig, ax = pyplot.subplots()
ax.grid()
ax.scatter([commute.took.total_seconds() / 60 for commute in normalized],
           [weather[commute.day].temperature for commute in normalized])
ax.set(xlabel='Commute time', ylabel='Temperature',
       title='Commute and weather')
ax.legend()
pyplot.show()
~~~

Correlation is slightly visible, on cold days commute is a bit faster:

![Commute and temperature](/assets/commute/temp.png)

With wind speed code is almost the same:

~~~python
fig, ax = pyplot.subplots()
ax.grid()
ax.scatter([commute.took.total_seconds() / 60 for commute in normalized],
           [weather[commute.day].windspeed for commute in normalized])
ax.set(xlabel='Commute time', ylabel='Wind speed',
       title='Commute and wind')
ax.legend()
pyplot.show()
~~~

And the correlation is more visible, the commute is slower with stronger wind:

![Commute and wind](/assets/commute/wind.png)

Then I've tried to combine the previous two graphs in one 3d graph:

~~~python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig, ax = pyplot.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})
ax.grid()
ax.scatter([weather[commute.day].temperature for commute in normalized],
           [weather[commute.day].windspeed for commute in normalized],
           [commute.took.total_seconds() / 60 for commute in normalized])
ax.set(xlabel='Wind speed', ylabel='Temperature', zlabel='Commute time',
       title='Commute and weather')
ax.legend()
pyplot.show()
~~~

And the result didn't give me anything:
