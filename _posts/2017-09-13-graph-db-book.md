![book cover white](/assets/graph_db_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read
something about graph databases and in [the Humble Book Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/data-science-books),
I found [Graph Databases by Jim Webber, Ian Robinson and Emil Eifrem](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028246.do).
The book is mostly focused on neo4j but has a bit of information about
other databases. It has examples of graph data models and real world use
cases, also the book contains an information about theoretical parts
and neo4j internals. And there's a lot about Cypher language. 

Although in some chapters the book can be described by *anything's a graph if
you're brave enough*.
