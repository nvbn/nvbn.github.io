![book cover white](/assets/data_intensive_book.jpg) Recently I wanted to read
something about applications design and distributed systems, so I found
and read [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do).
Overall it's a nice book with a bit of theoretical and practical information.
It explains how a lot of things work inside, like databases, messaging systems,
and batch/stream processing. The book is a bit high-level, but I guess because
of that it's easy and interesting to read.

Although the last chapter is a bit strange, a tinfoil hat kind of strange.
