![book cover](/assets/time_series_book.jpg) In [the recent Humble Book Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/data-science-books),
I've noticed a quite short [Time Series Databases by Ted Dunning, Ellen Friedman](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035435.do)
and read it during a flight. The book seems like a brief introduction
to time series databases with a comparison with other kinds of databases.
The book contains a few real life examples, a bit of theory
and explanations of the ideas and concept behind them. 

Interesting to read, but too short and not much deep.
