![book cover white](/assets/strategy_book.jpg) Not so long ago I wanted to read something
about a large scale architecture and mistakenly decided that
[Technology Strategy Patterns by Eben Hewitt](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/technology-strategy-patterns/9781492040866/) was about that. It's not, but it was still interesting to read. The book provides
a bunch of nice patterns for delivering information to product-people and stakeholders.
The book covers a few ways of doing long-range planning and analysis with some examples from
the real world. *It even has some Powerpoint and Excel advice.*

Although somehow the book was useful for me and I've learned a bunch of new stuff, I'm definitely not
the target audience of it.
