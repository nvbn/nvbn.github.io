![book cover](/assets/okrs_book.jpg) For a better understanding of OKRs, I've decided to read
[Introduction to OKRs by Christina Wodtke](https://www.oreilly.com/business/free/introduction-to-okrs.csp).
It's a very short book, but it explains why and how to set OKRs, and how to keep track of them.
The book isn't deep or something, but it contains almost everything I wanted to know about OKRs.

In contrast with some longer books, it's very nice to read something
that's not trying to repeat the same content ten times all over the book.
